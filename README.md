# Todo List

A todo list browser application inspired by the [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) interface.

Live demo here: https://zakibed.github.io/todo-list/

## Features

-   Create a project where you can start adding todos
-   Check off completed todos, star prioritized todos, and set their due dates
-   Sort todos in each project by their date due or added, in either ascending (oldest to newest) or descending (newest to oldest) order
-   Filter todos by properties – show all todos or only hide completed ones
-   Customize app's appearance – light/dark theme, multiple accent colors, and slightly different layout/border styles

## Made with…

-   HTML, CSS, and JS
-   [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns) for date handling and manipulation
-   [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for module bundling
